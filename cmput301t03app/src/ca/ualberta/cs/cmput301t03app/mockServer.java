/**
 * THIS IS FOR TESTING PURPOSES ONLY!!!
 * 
 * This class is used to mimic the server until we get the server up and running.  The purpose is to
 * generate a list of questions, answers and comments so that we can test loading, saving, getters, etc.
 * 
 * For now, please test populating the lists into the views with the data that is created within this
 * class.
